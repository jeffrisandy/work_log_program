# Work Log
Python Web Development Techdegree Project 3 - Work Log


## Description
In order to prepare better timesheets for your company, you've been asked to develop 
a terminal application for logging what work someone did on a certain day. 
The script should ask for a task name, how much time was spent on the task, 
and any general notes about the task. Record each of these items into a row of a CSV or
JSON file along with a date.

Provide a way for a user to find all of the tasks that were done on a certain date or 
that match a search string (either as a regular expression or a plain text search). 
Print a report of this information to the screen, including the date, title of task, 
time spent, and general notes.
